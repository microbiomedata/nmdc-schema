        # Note: The `make mkd-gh-deploy` command below uses the `mkd-%` target
        #       defined in `Makefile`. That target's action (i.e. recipe)
        #       strips off the `mkd-` prefix and passes the rest of the command
        #       to `$ poetry run mkdocs`, effectively translating the command
        #       below into `$ poetry run mkdocs gh-deploy`.
