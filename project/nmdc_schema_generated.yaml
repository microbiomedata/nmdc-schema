notes:
- MetaCyc expansion assumes we're talking about metacyc reactions and not genes, compounds
  etc.
- removed/commented out the comfusing 'identifier' slot
- removed/commented out all mentions and definitions of depth2 and subsurface_depth2
- depth2 should now be migrated to the has_maximum_value part of depth
- 'slots requested for Bioscales, but already available for Biosample : tot_phosp,
  tot_carb, tot_nitro_content, pH'
- 'informal ## section delimiters should be replaced with subsets ?'
- commented out insdc_biosample_identifiers insdc_secondary_sample_identifiers...
  need better understanding of id patterns (at least)
- commented out several MIxS terms assigned to Biosample because the definitions of
  those terms were commented out in mixs.yaml dues to shared slot uris
- resuming use of part_of to link Biosamples to Studies. eg releasing sample_link
  from that role

      Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
    - The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition of organisms
      in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level classification
      system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which an organism
      or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under Ecosystem
      are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent samples collected
      from a natural environment or from another organism or from engineered environments
      like bioreactors respectively.

    description: Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based

      is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
    - The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic and Terrestrial.
      Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual hosts or
      phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments like bioreactors,
      solid waste etc.

      type is in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
    - The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types like Marine
      or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air or Outdoor
      air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated samples, ecosystem
      type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system, Roots etc.

    - Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further divided
      (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone etc. in
      the Ecosystem subtype category.

      Specific ecosystem is in position 5/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
    - Specific ecosystems help to define samples based on very specific characteristics
      of an environment under the five-level classification system.

    notes:
    - 'abstracted pattern: prefix:typecode-authshoulder-blade(.version)?(_seqsuffix)?'
    - a minimum length of 3 characters is suggested for typecodes, but 1 or 2 characters
      will be accepted
    - typecodes must correspond 1:1 to a class in the NMDC schema. this will be checked
      via per-class id slot usage assertions
    - minting authority shoulders should probably be enumerated and checked in the
      pattern

    description: A local identifier or name that for the material sample used for
      extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. It can refer either to
      the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. It can have any
      format, but we suggest that you make it concise, unique and consistent within
      your lab, and as informative as possible. INSDC requires every sample name from
      a single Submitter to be unique. Use of a globally unique identifier for the
      field source_mat_id is recommended in addition to sample_name.

    comments:
    - Provides grouping of biosamples at level that's more specific than belonging
      to the same study
    - be very clear that this could be part of a larger site
    - In Bioscales, one might say that rhizosphere soil and bulk soil from around
      the same plant were obtained at the same site. In this case, the site would
      correspond to one tree.
    - might correspond to GOLD's identifier on a page like https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/biosample?id=Gb0305833

          used in one experiment (gravimetric water content and water holding capacity

        - Currently, the comments say to use UUIDs. However, if we implement assigning
          NMDC identifiers with the minter we dont need to require a GUID. It can
          be an optional field to fillout only if they already have a resolvable ID.
        comments:
        - Identifiers must be prefixed. Possible FAIR prefixes are IGSNs (http://www.geosamples.org/getigsn),
          NCBI biosample accession numbers, ARK identifiers (https://arks.org/). These
          IDs enable linking to derived analytes and subsamples. If you have not assigned
          FAIR identifiers to your samples, you can generate UUIDs (https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
        examples:
        - value: IGSN:AU1243
