      slots subject/predicate/object with generic semantics and minimal constraints.
      When this is subclasses, e.g. to disease-phenotype associations then slot usage
      may specify both local naming (e.g. subject=disease) and local constraints

      Enum bindings allow enums to be bound to any object, including complex nested

    comments:
    - the target type definition of the typeof slot is referred to as the "parent
      type"
    - the type definition containing the typeof slot is referred to as the "child
      type"
    - type definitions without a typeof slot are referred to as a "root type"
