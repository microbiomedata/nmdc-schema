  This module in the schema is for representing annotations including functional annotations of proteins and other gene products,
  as well as controlled terms for describing things like metabolites

notes:
  - Removed slot_uri of rdf:type from type slot. Is OntologyClass an appropriate range?

  FunctionalAnnotation:

      An assignment of a function term (e.g. reaction or pathway) that is executed by a gene product, or which the gene product plays an active role in.

      automatically, typically using HMM or Blast type methods
