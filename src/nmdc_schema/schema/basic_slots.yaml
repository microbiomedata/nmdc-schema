    description: >-
      A unique identifier for a thing.
      Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    notes:
      - "abstracted pattern: prefix:typecode-authshoulder-blade(.version)?(_seqsuffix)?"
      - 'a minimum length of 3 characters is suggested for typecodes, but 1 or 2 characters will be accepted'
      - 'typecodes must correspond 1:1 to a class in the NMDC schema. this will be checked via per-class id slot usage assertions'
      - 'minting authority shoulders should probably be enumerated and checked in the pattern'

      Due to confusion about what values are used for this slot, it is best not to use this slot.
      See https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/issues/248.
      MAM removed designates_type and rdf:type slot uri 2022-11-30
    range: string
    description: >-
      An optional string that specifies the type object. 
      This is used to allow for searches for different kinds of objects.
    examples:
      - value: nmdc:Biosample
      - value: nmdc:Study

  title:
    range: string
    multivalued: false
    description: >-
      A name given to the entity that differs from the name/label programmatically assigned to it.
      For example, when extracting study information for GOLD, the GOLD system has assigned a name/label.
      However, for display purposes, we may also wish the capture the title of the proposal that was used to fund the study.

      - dcterms:title

  alternative_titles:
    range: string
    multivalued: true
    description: >-
