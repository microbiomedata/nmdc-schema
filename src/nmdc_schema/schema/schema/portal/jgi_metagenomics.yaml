  dna_concentration:
    name: dna_concentration
    title: DNA concentration in ng/ul
    comments:
    - Units must be in ng/uL. Enter the numerical part only. Must be calculated using
      a fluorometric method. Acceptable values are 0-2000.
    examples:
    - value: '100'

    range: dna_cont_type_enum
    required: false
    recommended: true
  dna_cont_well:
    name: dna_cont_well
    title: DNA plate position
    comments:
    - Required when 'plate' is selected for container type.
    - Leave blank if the sample will be shipped in a tube.
    - JGI will not process samples in corner wells, so A1, A12, H1 and H12 will not pass validation.
    - For partial plates, fill by columns, like B1-G1,A2-H2,A3-D3 (NOT A2-A11,B1-B8).
    examples:
    - value: B2
    from_schema: https://example.com/nmdc_dh
    rank: 11
    string_serialization: '{96 well plate pos}'
    slot_group: JGI-Metagenomics

  dna_container_id:
    name: dna_container_id
    title: DNA container label
    comments:
    - Must be unique across all tubes and plates, and <20 characters. All samples
      in a plate should have the same plate label.
    examples:
    - value: Pond_MT_041618

  dna_samp_id:

    title: DNA sample ID
    todos:
    - Removed identifier = TRUE from dna_samp_ID in JGI_sample_slots, as a class can't
      have two identifiers. How to force uniqueness? Moot because that column will
      be prefilled?
