# Merging the Berkeley schema into the NMDC schema

This document is a retrospective on the changes made to the NMDC schema between major versions 10 and 11.

Motivations for the Berkeley schema development included:

- First class representations of "omics" methods beyond nucleic acid analysis, like mass spectrometry-based
  proteomics and metabolomics. Within the Berkeley schema development team, this effort has gone by names like
  "replacing `OmicsProcessing` with `DataGeneration`".
- Renaming and refactoring of the processes that model the processing of data, i.e. bioinformatics workflows.
- A continuation of bipartite (material->process->material->process) modeling for the processing of samples, following
  the bipartite modeling used in the bioinformatics workflows (data->process->data).
- Continuation of using example data files as unit tests of the schema.
- Switching numerous string-range slots to enumeration-range slots.
- A requirement that all data records assert their own type and the addition of support for polymorphic aggregations of
  data.
- Establishing schema development and modeling best practices and sharing domain understanding between subteams.

## Conventions:

- `This monospaced code font` is used to indicate the verbatim names of elements from the schema and variables,
  functions, etc. in code.
- Things that appear in the monospaced code font and use `UpperCamelCase` are schema classes unless otherwise noted.
- Things that appear in the monospaced code font and use `lower_snake_case` are schema slots unless otherwise noted.
- Other LinkML schema [naming conventions](https://linkml.io/linkml/schemas/linter.html#standard-naming) are not
  discussed here.
- A dotted notation in the monospaced code font, with elements in UpperCamelCase, like
  `Vehicle.MotorVehicle.PassengerCar`
  indicates a class hierarchy. `PassengerCar is_a MotorVehicle` and `MotorVehicle is_a Vehicle`.

## Refactoring of Classes

This major refactoring increases the number of **classes** in the schema from 70 to 75, but decreases the number of root
classes from 19 to 17 due to better organization.

_You won't find any classes designated as root classes in the schema,
but they can be inferred by the absence of any `is_a` assertions on the class. Root classes do not inherit anything
from any superclass. A routine part of schema maintenance is looking for opportunities to group and generalize similar
root classes._

|                                       | `MaterialProcessing`                       |                             |
|                                       | `MobilePhaseSegment`                       |                             |
|                                       | `NucleotideSequencing`                     |                             |
|                                       | `PortionOfSubstance`                       |                             |
|                                       | `ProtocolExecution`                        |                             |
|                                       | `StorageProcess`                           |                             |
|                                       | `WorkflowExecution`                        |                             |

For example, the `MetagenomeAnnotationActivity` class used to be located in the hierarchy
`Activity.WorkFlowExecutionActivity`, but now it and 11 similar classes are located in the hierarchy
`NamedThing.PlannedProcess.WorkflowExecution`. The word `Activity`, inherited from the Provenance Ontology, has largely
been removed from the schema, as `PlannedProcess` from the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations now plays a more
important organizational role.

### v10.9.1

![Activity.png](../images/Activity.png)

`ProtocolExecution` has been added as a `PlannedProcess` for aggregating other processes together when they follow the
same `Protocol`.

![ProtocolExecution.png](../images/ProtocolExecution.png)

Several other kinds of processual classes were also migrated into the `NamedThing.PlannedProcess`, with or without
renaming or other refactoring. For example, the fairly vague root class `OmicsProcessing` is now
`NamedThing.PlannedProcess.DataGeneration`, which now has the following subclasses:

- `MassSpectrometry`
- `NucleotideSequencing`

The legacy `BiosampleProcessing` class (including `Pooling`, `LibraryPreparation`) and some classes that were previously
direct subclasses of `PlannedProcess` (`Extraction`, `SubSamplingProcess`, `MixingProcess`, `FiltrationProcess`,
`ChromatographicSeparationProcess`) have been re-rooted into a new `MaterialProcessing` class.

`DissolvingProcess` and `ChemicalConversionProcess` are new subclasses of `MaterialProcessing`.

### v11.0.1

![MaterialProcessing.png](../images/MaterialProcessing.png)

`StorageProcess` has been added as a new  `PlannedProcess` but the schema does not classify it as a
`MaterialProcessing` because it does not intrinsically create new/modified samples.

Terms that implied quantification like `MetaboliteQuantification` have been renamed to reemphasize the more fundamental
activity of identifying, thus `MetaboliteIdentification`.

A `CalibrationInformation` class, a `Configuration` class and two `Configuration` subclasses (illustrated below) have
been added in support of chromatographic separations and mass spectrometry analyses. These are subclasses of the
new `InformationObject`, which has also become the parent of `DataObject`, which used to be a direct subclass
of `NamedThing`.

### v11.0.1

![InformationObject.png](../images/InformationObject.png)

### v11.0.1

![Configuration.png](../images/Configuration.png)

Solution-centric modelling for laboratory processes was also replaced with substance-centric modelling.

### Removed:

- `Solution`
- `SolutionComponent`

### Added:

- `PortionOfSubstance`
- `MobilePhaseSegment`

### v11.0.1

![PortionOfSubstance.png](../images/PortionOfSubstance.png)

### v11.0.1

![MobilePhaseSegment.png](../images/MobilePhaseSegment.png)

The Berkeley schema retains the `AttributeValue` hierarchy but eliminates classes like `IntegerValue` and `UrlValue`,
whose only advantages over values of integer or string types were never-used provenance slots.

### v10.9.0

![AttributeValue10.png](../images/AttributeValue10.png)

### v11.0.1

![AttributeValue11.png](../images/AttributeValue11.png)

Classes related to metabolic reactions that a cell could carry out, based on some functionality in its genome, have been
removed, due to potential confusion with reactions that an experimenter might carry out in order to make a sample
suitable for analysis.

### Removed:

- `Reaction`
- `ReactionParticipant`

### Added

- `ChemicalConversionProcess`

A very general `Instrument` class was added as a subclass of `MaterialEntity`, but without any subclasses. Knowledge
about instruments is captured directly in NMDC's MongoDB database. The instances are normalized by populating their
`vendor` slot with a value from the `InstrumentVendorEnum` and by populating the `model` slot with a value from the
`InstrumentModelEnum`. Mappings between these NMDC vocabularies and vocabularies from collaborators like NCBI and GOLD
are saved in various repos like nmdc-schema and nmdc-runtime.

`AnalyticalSample` was removed from the `MaterialEntity` hierarchy, as NMDC does not wish to imply that certain samples
could be used for analyses or that others could not be used for analyses, or even that some samples are locked into an
analytical path, such that they could not be subject to any more `MaterialProcessing`.

## Refactoring of Slots

The number of **slots** in the schema remains 872 after the Berkeley merger, although there are 44 slots that have been
retired from the legacy schema and 44 that were added in the switch from v10 to v11.

Many of the slot changes can be understood by looking at the Python data migration code in `nmdc_schema/migrators`.

A major explanation for the slot differences is the adoption of a _polymorphic_ (i.e., multi-shaped) _model_ for slots
in the `Database` class, which corresponds to polymorphic collections in the v11-compliant MongoDB database. In the
legacy model, the range for each of the `Database` slots was intended to be one class, with no provision for class
hierarchy. In the new model, the range for each slot is still specified as a single class, but each `Database` slot can
now collect instances of that specified class, plus the instances of any subclass of the specified class.

### Slots removed from `Database`

* `extraction_set`
* `library_preparation_set`
* `mags_activity_set`
* `metabolomics_analysis_activity_set`
* `metagenome_annotation_activity_set`
* `metagenome_assembly_set`
* `metagenome_sequencing_activity_set`
* `metaproteomics_analysis_activity_set`
* `metatranscriptome_annotation_set`
* `metatranscriptome_assembly_set`
* `metatranscriptome_expression_analysis_set`
* `nom_analysis_activity_set`
* `omics_processing_set`
* `planned_process_set`
* `pooling_set`
* `read_based_taxonomy_analysis_activity_set`
* `read_qc_analysis_activity_set`

### Slots added to `Database`

* `calibration_set`
* `chemical_entity_set`
* `chromatographic_category`
* `configuration_set`
* `data_generation_set`
* `instrument_set`
* `material_processing_set`
* `protocol_execution_set`
* `storage_process_set`
* `workflow_execution_set`

So now, instances of `MetaproteomicsAnalysis`, `MetatranscriptomeAnnotation` and `NomAnalysis` are all collected (or
aggregated) in `workflow_execution_set`.

These polymorphic collection are enabled by a significant modeling change in v11 of the schema: a strict requirement
that, within any representation of schema-compliant data, that all instances of all classes declare their own `type`.
Furthermore, the values in the `type` slot must be the `class_uri` of the instantiated class. That, in turn, means that
all classes must now declare a `class_uri` and that the `type` slots must be associated with each class. This is
enforced with the following Python tests:

* test_all_classes_assert_a_class_uri.py
* test_all_classes_can_use_type_slot.py

Note that classes should not re-associate themselves with any slot that they inherit from a superclass. For example, the
class definition for `Study` inherits the `id` slot from `NamedThing`, so `Study` doesn't include `id` in its `slots`
list. This no-reasserting rule is tested with `test_inherited_slots_not_reiterated.py`.

Also note that the legacy v10 schema did include a `type` slot, but it was used very inconsistently. v10 also had a
similar `designated_class` slot which has been retired.

The following slots were removed as a consequence of removing the `Reaction` class and beginning the process of
deprecating the `Pathway` class:

* `chemical`
* `direction`
* `has_part`
* `has_participants`
* `is_balanced`
* `is_diastereoselective`
* `is_fully_characterized`
* `is_stereo`
* `is_transport`
* `left_participants`
* `right_participants`
* `smarts_string`
* `stoichiometry`

`compound` and `has_solution_components` were removed as a consequence of removing the `Solution` class.

The string-typed `instrument_name` and `used` were removed due to refactoring around the new `Instrument` class and the
`instrument_used` slot, which is associated with numerous `PlannedProcess` subclasses.

The following changes have been made to slots in the `Extraction` class:

* `extractant` was replaced with `substances_used`
* `extraction_method` was replaced with `protocol_link`
* `extraction_target` was replaced with a `multivalued` slot `extraction_targets`

The string-typed `relevant_protocols` slot has been replaced with the `protocol_link` slot, which uses the `Protocol`
class as its range.

The string-typed `has_raw_value` has been replaced with `analyte_category`, which has an enumerated range. The following
are the **permissible values** for `analyte_category`:

* `metagenome`
* `metatranscriptome`
* `metaproteome`
* `metabolome`
* `lipidome`
* `nom`

In keeping with the focus on identification rather that quantification, `has_metabolite_quantifications` has been
replaced with `has_metabolite_identifications` and `metabolite_quantified` has been replaced with
`metabolite_identified`.

`alternate_emails` and `keywords` were removed due to lack of use.

The `part_of` slots have been replaced in many cases with more specific slots. For example, `Biosample` now has an
`associated_studies` relationship with `Study`.

The NMDC schema has always imported many slots from the MIxS standard, and has generally associated them with the
`Biosample` class. In schema v11, several of those have been de-associated with `Biosample` as they are arguably
attributes of laboratory methods, not about samples of biological materials that are extracted from some environment.

* `chimera_check`
* `nucl_acid_amp`
* `nucl_acid_ext`
* `pcr_cond`
* `pcr_primers`
* `pool_dna_extracts`
* `samp_vol_we_dna_ext`
* `seq_meth`
* `seq_quality_check`
* `target_gene`
* `target_subfragment`

Some, but not all, of those slots were re-associated with `Extraction`, `LibraryPreparation`, or `NucleotideSequencing`.

`has_process_parts` has been added to capture the relationship between a `ProtocolExecution` and the `Process` instances
that were carried out with the intention of completing a specified protocol under specified circumstances.

The following slots have been added in support of the new `CalibrationInformation` and `Configuration` modelling for
`MassSpectrometry`. The new schema's increased use of boolean and enumerated ranges (as opposed to
open-ended string ranges) is nicely illustrated by these slots.

* `calibration_object`
* `calibration_standard`
* `calibration_target`
* `internal_calibration`
* `has_chromatography_configuration`
* `has_mass_spectrometry_configuration`

The following slots have been added, specifically on `MassSpectrometryConfiguration`, so that a small number of
`MassSpectrometryConfiguration` instances can be reused to describe the following:

* `mass_analyzers`
* `mass_spectrometry_acquisition_strategy`
* `mass_spectrum_collection_modes`
* `ionization_source`
* `polarity_mode`
* `resolution_categories`

These new slots are examplars of the increased emphasis on enumeration ranges (and the avoidance of the word 'type' in
slot names other than `type`):

- `analyte_category`
- `chemical_conversion_category`
- `chromatographic_category` _applicable to `ChromatographyConfiguration` and `ChromatographicSeparationProcess` ?_
- `data_category`
- `eluent_introduction_category`
- `feature_category`
- `protocol_execution_category`

The following new slots support the change from solution-based modeling to substance-based modelling:

* `substance_role`
* `substances_used`
* `substances_volume`
* `source_concentration`
* `final_concentration`
* `sample_state_information`

The `ChemicalEntity` class has been refactored for nmdc-schema v11, and is likely to undergo additional changes in later
2024 and 2025. For now, a `known_as` slot has been added to allow for flexibility in `PortionOfSubstance` and retain
precision in `ChemicalEntity`.

`extraction_targets` was added to `Extraction`. `sampled_portion` was added to `SubSamplingProcess` and
`jgi_portal_analysis_project_identifiers`.

## Refactoring of Enumerations

The following enumerations were removed:

- `CompoundEnum`
- `DeviceEnum`

`processing_institution_enum` was renamed to `ProcessingInstitutionEnum`.

And the following **enumerations** were added:

- `AnalyteCategoryEnum`
- `CalibrationStandardEnum`
- `CalibrationTargetEnum`
- `ChemicalConversionCategoryEnum`
- `ChromatographicCategoryEnum`
- `DataCategoryEnum`
- `EluentIntroductionCategoryEnum`
- `ExecutionResourceEnum`
- `IonizationSourceEnum`
- `MassAnalyzerEnum`
- `MassSpectrometryAcquisitionStrategyEnum`
- `MassSpectrumCollectionModeEnum`
- `PolarityModeEnum`
- `ProcessingInstitutionEnum`
- `ProtocolCategoryEnum`
- `ResolutionCategoryEnum`
- `SamplePortionEnum`
- `SampleStateEnum`
- `SubstanceRoleEnum`

## Refactoring of prefixes

Expansions for the following **prefixes** were added:

- **NCBI** _needs better modeling for NCBI taxonomy identifiers_
- **SO**
- **jgi.analysis**
- **MISO**

## Refactoring of example data files

v10 of the schema provided 168 example data files. v11 has increased that to 224, providing better testing coverage of
the schema via the `run-linkml-example` phase of `make test`.

v11 is also more thorough in annotating abstract classes, with 11, compared to 7 in v10. That includes a new `abstract`
annotation for `AttributeValue`,  `MaterialProcessing` (which essentially replaces `BiosampleProcessing`) and
`DataGeneration` (which essentially replaces `OmicsProcessing`).

## Methods used to compare the two versions of the schema

Running the whole schema though a tool like deepdiff can be overwhelming, but extracting a single class from two
versions of the schema and then deep diffing them like this can be enlightening. Note that we are not `curl`-ing
or `wget`-ing the schemas from GitHub, but rather using LinkML `SchemaView()` to fetch the root schema file and then
merge in all of its imports.

The deepdiff results are then piped through `yq` with the `-P` option to convert to YAML. `yq` is distributed as a snap
package in some Linux distributions, and snap applications can't generally write to standard output, so we add the
otherwise redundant step of piping the output though cat in order to write to a file.

```

This reveals that the `class_uri` and `protocol_link` slots were added as described above. The `from_schema` values
reveals the fact that v11 splits the elements of the schema into different YAML source files. The large number of files
was intended to make it easier to debug build errors, but it has been difficult to split the contents into files that
have a consistent domain or topic.

The diff also shows the removal of the `id`, `alternative_identifiers`, `description`, `relevant_protocols` and `type`
slots, which might be counter-intuitive, until one considers that all of those slots are inherited from `Study`'s
parent, `NamedThing` and that schema v11 forbids re-asserting slots that are inherited from a superclass.

## Challenges with the use of `structured_pattern`s in `slot_usage`s for approximating referential integrity, etc.

LinkML slot definitions must assert their `range`, typically as a type (like `string` or `float`), an enumeration, or a
class. If they don't, they inherit the schema's default_range, which is `string` in the nmdc-schema.

LinkML is able to validate that a slot, used in a data source (file or database collection), is populated with an entity
of the right type (i.e. is in range) in almost all cases. Unfortunately, one of the cases that currently can not be
validated is extremely important to NMDC: checking the data populated into a slot whose range is a non-inlined class.
This case can also be described as the slot mentioning an instance of a class by reference. _For the record, this
requires that the mentioned class has an identifying slot of its own._ An example of this is
the [associated_studies](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/associated_studies/) slot in the `Biosample`
class, which has the `Study` class as its range. The definition of `associated_studies` does not assert `inlined`
or `inlined_as_list` to be true, and the `Study` class inherits
the [id](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/id/#linkml-source) slot as an identifier
from [NamedThing](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/NamedThing/). Therefore, the value of
an `associated_studies` slot in a data file must be the `id` of a `Study`.

**In the absense of any other data or constraints**, the nmdc-schema will consider the following assertion valid for
a `Biosample`, even if `xyz` isn't defined in the same data source:

```yaml
associated_studies:
  - xyz
```

If `xyz` is defined in the data source **and** it does not pass validation as a `Study`, then the `Biosample` will also
be considered invalid. Unfortunately, the definitions and mentions of nmdc-schema instances are frequently split across
different MongoDB collections, so validating that a referred instance is really of the right type is non-trivial.

As a very lightweight guard against referring to instances of the wrong type, `stuctured_pattern`s were added
to `slot_usage`s in berkeley-schema-fy24, and also independently in nmdc-schema v10 during the development of
berkeley-schema-fy24/v11. In addition to being incomplete, this solution introduces some minor problems into the schema,
and it relies on some other advanced LinkML features. Still, it has been useful in debugging some schema/data problems
that slipped though the cracks in the past.

For example, the following can be found inside of `Biosample`'s `slot_usage` block now:

```yaml
      associated_studies:
        required: true
        range: Study
        structured_pattern:
          syntax: "{id_nmdc_prefix}:sty-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$"
          interpolated: true
```

That means that the value after `associated_studies:` in a `Biosample` must be the `id` of a `Study` instance, but also
must be a string matching some pattern. The pattern is only revealed if all of the `syntax` elements in curly brackets
are defined in the `settings` block of the schema, and if the schema has been fed though the `gen-likml` command line
too with `--materialize-patterns` enabled. In the `nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml` schema, one can see the
intended pattern:

```yaml
      associated_studies:
        name: associated_studies
        range: Study
        required: true
        pattern: ^(nmdc):sty-([0-9][a-z]{0,6}[0-9])-([A-Za-z0-9]{1,})$
        structured_pattern:
          syntax: '{id_nmdc_prefix}:sty-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$'
          interpolated: true
```

Therefore, when using `nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml` for validation, a `Biosample` with
this assertion:

```yaml
associated_studies:
  - xyz
```

would fail validation,
because `'xyz' does not match '^(nmdc):sty-([0-9][a-z]{0,6}[0-9])-([A-Za-z0-9]{1,})$'` (See https://regexr.com/87a0s).
NMDC's use of `structured_pattern` `slot_usage`s is a manual effort to align the `id` pattern specified in a class's
definition with a constraint on how identifiers for instances of that class are mentioned in a slot.

Now that we have addressed `structured_pattern`s including `settings` and `gen-linkml`, let's
address `slot_usage`s, which are attributes of LinkML classes that are intended to refine the behavior of slots,
relative to their global definition within the schema. For example, here's the global definition of `has_input`:

```yaml
  has_input:
    aliases:
      - input
    range: NamedThing
    multivalued: true
    description: >-
      An input to a process.
```

The only constraint is that the value of `has_input` must be the `id` of a `NamedThing`, since `has_input` doesn't
assert `inlined` or `inlined_as_list`, and `NamedThing` used `id` as it's identifying slot. As previously mentioned,
`structured_pattern`s can be used to improve the validation of this slot in some circumstances, but there are multiple
classes that use `has_input`, and they don't all use the same range for `has_input`. For
example, [CollectingBiosamplesFromSite](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/CollectingBiosamplesFromSite/)
specifies that it's range for `has_input` is `Site`. _Note that not all nmdc-schema contributors are in favor of those
semantics._

```yaml
  has_input:
    range: Site
    description: >-
      The site from which samples are collected.
```

That `slot_usage` does not assert a `structured_pattern`, but many of them do. There are also classes that
use `has_input` without any `range` constraint in their `slot_usage`, but might be clearer if they did. For example,
[WorkflowExecution](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/WorkflowExecution/) should probably specify that it
only uses [DataObject](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/DataObject/) in the range of its `has_input`. This
would provide useful clarity to diagramming tools
like [refgraph](https://github.com/microbiomedata/refscan?tab=readme-ov-file#refgraph).

Finally, we should point out that some `slot_usage` `range`s in nmdc-schema use the LinkML `any_of` construct. For
example, here's part of the `slot_usage`
for [MaterialProcessing](https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/MaterialProcessing/):

```yaml
      has_input:
        any_of:
          - range: Biosample
          - range: ProcessedSample
        structured_pattern:
          syntax: "{id_nmdc_prefix}:(bsm|procsm)-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$"
          interpolated: true
```

That might be seen as asserting that `MaterialProcessing`'s `range` is **either** `Biosample` or `ProcessedSample`,
but `has_input` has the global `range` of `NamedThing`, so the effective range for `has_input` in `MaterialProcessing`
is the union of `NamedThing`, `Biosample` and  `ProcessedSample`.

Note that the `slot_usage` `strucutred_pattern` essentially asserts two different `strucutured_pattern` `syntax`es, due
to the use of the `|` character: "{id_nmdc_prefix}:bsm-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$" for `Biosample`s and
"{id_nmdc_prefix}:procsm-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$" for `ProcessedSample`s.

### Summary of challenges

- LinkML validation does not guarantee that references have been checked for presence and correct form within a
  distributed data ecosystem.
- `slot_usage` is complex to understand and use.
- `structured_pattern` requires the definition of `settings` and pattern materialization with `gen-linkml` in order to
  be useful.
- LinkML doesn't provide any automation for the alignment of `id` patterns in class definitions, `slot_usage`
  `structured_pattern`s, and `slot_usage` `range`s.
- A human's refinement- or narrowing-based understanding of `any_of` `range`s may not match LinkML's union-based
  understanding.
- `any_of` `range`s can easily override global slot definitions, when they are meant to refine them (in the spirit of
  monotonicity).
- `slot_usage` `structured_pattern`s, as used in the nmdc-schema, imply that the ranges of some slots are both a
  referred thing (asserted in the `range`), and a string (by way of the pattern). That can never be true, and it breaks
  the functionality of some derived artifacts, such as OWL and RDF.

The LinkML and NMDC teams are currently working on more sophisticated solutions for interpreting `any_of` `range`s,
checking referential integrity and for making `structured_pattern` materialization the default in any situation that
used the schema.
