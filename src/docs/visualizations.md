## Inter-collection relationship diagram

<!-- Note: `visualizations/collection-graph.html` does not exist in the source code repository.
           It gets generated as part of the documentation build process. -->
This [**inter-collection relationship diagram**](visualizations/collection-graph.html)
shows the database **collections** described by the schema, and the **relationships** between those collections.

Each circle represents a collection.
Each arrow represents all of the fields that documents in one collection—the one at that arrow's tail—can
use to refer to documents in another collection—the one at that arrow's head.
If you click on a circle, the names of the fields will appear on the arrows connected to that circle.

## Inter-class relationship diagram

<!-- Note: `visualizations/class-graph.html` does not exist in the source code repository.
           It gets generated as part of the documentation build process. -->
This [**inter-class relationship diagram**](visualizations/class-graph.html)
shows the **classes** defined within the schema, and the **relationships** between those classes.

Each circle represents a class.
Each arrow represents all of the slots that instances of that class—the one at that arrow's tail—can
use to refer to instances of another class—the one at that arrow's head.
If you click on a circle, the names of the slots will appear on the arrows connected to that circle.
