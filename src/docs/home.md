# NMDC Schema

The purpose of the NMDC Schema is to define metadata for the [National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC)](https://microbiomedata.org/). The [NMDC](https://microbiomedata.org/) is a multi-organizational effort to enable integrated microbiome data across diverse areas in medicine, agriculture, bioenergy, and the environment. This integrated platform facilitates comprehensive discovery of and access to multidisciplinary microbiome data in order to unlock new possibilities with microbiome data science. 

The NMDC schema is used during the translation process to specify how metadata elements are related.
