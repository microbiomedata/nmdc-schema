# Using LinkML SchemaView in NMDC

## Introduction

Please see LinkML SchemaView documentation for general information.
It has several good examples of how to use this module in a python script or from the command line.

There are also several notebooks that demonstrate SchemaView usage in the LinkML-runtime repository:

Finally, the Biolink Model Toolkit is a helper wrapper around SchemaView for use with the Biolink Model and it
has many examples of customizing SchemaView output for Biolink Model specific use cases.  Similar customizations
may be helpful for NMDC.
