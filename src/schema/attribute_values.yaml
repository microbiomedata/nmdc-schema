    comments:
      - DOIs should not be included as websites. Instead, use the associated_dois slot.
      - A consortium's homepage website should be included in the homepage_website slot, not in websites.
      - consortium is a convenience term for a Study whose study_category value is consortium
      - the website slot and its subproperties are virtually identical to the url slot, except that they are multivalued and url is single-valued.
