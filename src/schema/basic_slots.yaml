  id:
    identifier: true
    multivalued: false
    description: >-
      A unique identifier for a thing.
      Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    #required: false # for now we are setting this to false until we develop an id template

  name:
    multivalued: false
    range: string
    description: >-
      A human readable label for an entity

  description:
    range: string
    multivalued: false

      Due to confusion about what values are used for this slot, it is best not to use this slot.
      See https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/issues/248.
    range: string
    description: >-
      An optional string that specifies the type object. 
      This is used to allow for searches for different kinds of objects.
    designates_type: true
    examples:
      - value: nmdc:Biosample
      - value: nmdc:Study

  title:
    range: string
    multivalued: false
    description: >-
      A name given to the entity that differs from the name/label programmatically assigned to it.
      For example, when extracting study information for GOLD, the GOLD system has assigned a name/label.
      However, for display purposes, we may also wish the capture the title of the proposal that was used to fund the study.

      - dcterms:title

  alternative titles:
