        annotations:
          source: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/ecosystem_classification
  ecosystem:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      An ecosystem is a combination of a physical environment (abiotic
      factors) and all the organisms (biotic factors) that interact with this environment.
      Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      - The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition
        of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level
        classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which
        an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under
        Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent
        samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from
        engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  ecosystem_category:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based
      on specific characteristics of the environment from where an organism or sample
      is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      - The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic
        and Terrestrial. Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual
        hosts or phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments
        like bioreactors, solid waste etc.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  ecosystem_type:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem types represent things having common characteristics within
      the Ecosystem Category. These common characteristics based grouping is still
      broad but specific to the characteristics of a given environment. Ecosystem
      type is in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      - The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types
        like Marine or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air
        or Outdoor air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated
        samples, ecosystem type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system,
        Roots etc.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  ecosystem_subtype:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem subtypes represent further subdivision of Ecosystem types
      into more distinct subtypes. Ecosystem subtype is in position 4/5 in a GOLD
      path.
    comments:
      - Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further
        divided (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone
        etc. in the Ecosystem subtype category.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  specific_ecosystem:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Specific ecosystems represent specific features of the environment
      like aphotic zone in an ocean or gastric mucosa within a host digestive system.
      Specific ecosystem is in position 5/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      - Specific ecosystems help to define samples based on very specific characteristics
        of an environment under the five-level classification system.
