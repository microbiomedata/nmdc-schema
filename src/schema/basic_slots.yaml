title: Basic Slots for NMDC Schema
description: >-
  Basic Linkml slots that are used across the Schema for National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC).
  Examples include "id", "name", "description". These slots have primitive data types (e.g., sting) as ranges.

    description: >-
      A unique identifier for a thing.
      Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    notes:
      - "abstracted pattern: prefix:typecode-authshoulder-blade(.version)?(_seqsuffix)?"
      - 'a minimum length of 3 characters is suggested for typecodes, but 1 or 2 characters will be accepted'
      - 'typecodes must correspond 1:1 to a class in the NMDC schema. this will be checked via per-class id slot usage assertions'
      - 'minting authority shoulders should probably be enumerated and checked in the pattern'
    examples:
      - value: nmdc:mgmag-00-x012.1_7_c1
        description: 'https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/pull/499#discussion_r1018499248'

  name:
    range: string
    description: >-
      A human readable label for an entity

  description:

    description: >-
      a human-readable description of a thing
    slot_uri: dcterms:description

  type:
    deprecated: >-
      Due to confusion about what values are used for this slot, it is best not to use this slot.
      See https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/issues/248.
      MAM removed designates_type and rdf:type slot uri 2022-11-30
    range: string
    description: >-
      An optional string that specifies the type object. 
      This is used to allow for searches for different kinds of objects.
    examples:
      - value: nmdc:Biosample
      - value: nmdc:Study

  title:
    range: string
    description: >-
      A name given to the entity that differs from the name/label programmatically assigned to it.
      For example, when extracting study information for GOLD, the GOLD system has assigned a name/label.
      However, for display purposes, we may also wish the capture the title of the proposal that was used to fund the study.
    exact_mappings:
      - dcterms:title

  alternative_titles:
    range: string
    multivalued: true
    description: >-
      A list of alternative titles for the entity.
      The distinction between title and alternative titles is application-specific.
    exact_mappings:
      - dcterms:alternative

  alternative_names:
    range: string
    multivalued: true
    description: >-
      A list of alternative names used to refer to the entity.
      The distinction between name and alternative names is application-specific.

      - skos:altLabel

  alternative_descriptions:
    range: string
    multivalued: true
    description: >-
      A list of alternative descriptions for the entity.
      The distinction between description and alternative descriptions is application-specific.

  alternative_identifiers:
    range: uriorcurie
    multivalued: true
    description: >-
      A list of alternative identifiers for the entity.

  start_date:
    range: string
    description: The date on which any process or activity was started
    comments:
      - We are using string representations of dates until all components of our ecosystem can handle ISO 8610 dates
      - The date should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
    todos:
      - add date string validation pattern

  end_date:
    range: string
    description: The date on which any process or activity was ended
    comments:
      - We are using string representations of dates until all components of our ecosystem can handle ISO 8610 dates
      - The date should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
    todos:
      - add date string validation pattern

  instrument_used:
    description: The device or tool that performed or aided in performing a process.
    comments:
      - not to be confused with 'used' which currently has a string range
    todos:
      - annotate me!
      - should include the union of named and anonymous instruments, either with any_of or by future inheritance

  #  failure_what:

  #    description: >-
  #      Provides a summary about what caused a lab or workflow process to fail
  #      (ie Low read count from a sequencer, malformed fastq files, etc)
  #
  #  failure_where:
  #    range: FailureWhereEnum
  #    description: >-
  #      Describes the nmdc schema class that corresonds to where the failure occurred.
  #      Most commonly this would be the same as Class that generated the results.
  #      If the assembly size was too small to proceed to annotation failure_where would be MetagenomeAssembly.

  #  comment:
  #    range: string
  #    description: >-
  #      Slot to store additional comments about laboratory or workflow output. For workflow output
  #      it may describe the particular workflow stage that failed. (ie Failed at call-stage due to a malformed fastq file).

  instrument_name:
    description: >-
      The name of the instrument that was used for processing the sample.
