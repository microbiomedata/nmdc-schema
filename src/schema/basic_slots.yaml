  Basic Linkml slots that are used across the Schema for National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC).
  Examples include "id", "name", "description". These slots have primitive data types (e.g., sting) as ranges.

    notes:
      - MAM prefers to use this functionality in a `type` class and to eliminate '...type...' from the names
        of any NMDC-owned elements
      - this would be required on all instances in a polymorphic Database slot, like planned_process_set

      Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    notes:
      - "abstracted pattern: prefix:typecode-authshoulder-blade(.version)?(_seqsuffix)?"
      - 'a minimum length of 3 characters is suggested for typecodes, but 1 or 2 characters will be accepted'
      - 'typecodes must correspond 1:1 to a class in the NMDC schema. this will be checked via per-class id slot usage assertions'
      - 'minting authority shoulders should probably be enumerated and checked in the pattern'

      Due to confusion about what values are used for this slot, it is best not to use this slot.

    range: string
    description: >-
      An optional string that specifies the type object. 
      This is used to allow for searches for different kinds of objects.
    examples:

  title:
    range: string
    description: >-
      A name given to the entity that differs from the name/label programmatically assigned to it.
      For example, when extracting study information for GOLD, the GOLD system has assigned a name/label.
      However, for display purposes, we may also wish the capture the title of the proposal that was used to fund the study.

    range: FailureWhatEnum
    description: >-
      Provides a summary about what caused a lab or workflow process to fail
    comments:
      - For example Low read count from a sequencer, malformed fastq files, etc)

  qc_failure_where:
    domain: FailureCategorization
    range: FailureWhereEnum
    description: >-
      Describes the nmdc schema class that corresonds to where the failure occurred.
      Most commonly this would be the same as Class that generated the results.
    comments:
      - If the assembly size was too small to proceed to annotation failure_where would be MetagenomeAssembly.

  qc_comment:
    range: string
    description: >-
      Slot to store additional comments about laboratory or workflow output. For workflow output
      it may describe the particular workflow stage that failed. (ie Failed at call-stage due to a malformed fastq file).
