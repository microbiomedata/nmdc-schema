        the same plant were obtained at the same site. In this case, the site would
        correspond to one tree.

            where 0 is north-facing, 90 is east-facing, 180 is south-facing, and 270 is west-facing.
        description:
          The direction a slope faces. While looking down a slope use a compass to record the direction you are facing (direction or degrees).
          This measure provides an indication of sun and wind exposure that will influence soil temperature and evapotranspiration.

            aluminum held by the cation exchange complex is in equilibrium with aluminum in the soil solution.
        examples:
          - value: 27%
        todos:
          - Example & validation. Can we configure things so that 27% & 27 % & 0.27 will validate?
          - I think it's weird the way GSC writes the title. I recommend this change. Thoughts?
            I would argue this isn't an extreme unusual property. It's just a biogeochemical measurement.

        comments:
          - Identifiers must be prefixed. Possible FAIR prefixes are IGSNs (http://www.geosamples.org/getigsn),
            NCBI biosample accession numbers, ARK identifiers (https://arks.org/).
            These IDs enable linking to derived analytes and subsamples.
            If you have not assigned FAIR identifiers to your samples,
            you can generate UUIDs (https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
        examples:
          - value: IGSN:AU1243
          - value: UUID:24f1467a-40f4-11ed-b878-0242ac120002
        todos:
          - Currently, the comments say to use UUIDs. However, if we implement assigning NMDC identifiers with the minter
            we dont need to require a GUID. It can be an optional field to fill out only if they already have a resolvable ID.

    comments:
      - Can be assembled into a list to account for a gradient.
      - Works best for separations that can be accounted for by a series of essentially linear changes in the mobile phase composition.
      - For gradients, each segment should declare it's duration.
      - For step-wise separations that might be implemented with a syringe and a cartridge, it will probably be more important to assert volumes.
