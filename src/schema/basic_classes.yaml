  OntologyRelation:
    aliases: ["OntologyAssociation"]
    description: >-
      A relationship between two ontology classes as specified either directly in the ontology in the form
      of axioms (statements or assertions that defines rules or constraints in an ontology) or inferred via
      reasoning.  The association object is defined by two terms (the subject and the object) and the relationship
      between them (the predicate). Because ontologies often have a plethora of relationships/axiom types and can have
      additional metadata on the relationship itself, these kinds of relationships are structured as a class instead
      of a simple set of slots on OntologyClass itself.
    comments: >-
      For example, the relationship between 'soil' and 'enriched soil' in the Environmental Ontology (ENVO)
      is defined by the following axioms: 'enriched soil' subclass_of 'soil', and 'enriched soil' 
      has_increased_levels_of (some) 'material entity.'  Converting these statâˆ‚ements to OntologyAssociations 
      so they can be used in the NMDC data stores, the subject of the first axiom or statement, 
      would be 'soil', the predicate would be 'subclass_of', and the object would be 'enriched soil'.  For the second
      axiom, the subject would be 'enriched soil', the predicate would be 'has_increased_levels_of', and the object
      would be 'material entity.' (Note that text labels are used in this example for ease of understanding and 
      the literal values of subject, predicate, and object in this class will be the id (curie) of the 
      `OntologyClass` as defined below).  Not all ontology axioms (associations) between terms need to be 
      ingested into the NMDC data stores.  In general, subclass_of and part_of relationships/axioms are often 
      good default relations/associations to support ontology browsing in user interfaces.

    comments:
      - The direct subclasses of NamedThing should aggregate the relevant classes and make them uniform. PlannedProcess and MaterialEntity are clearly disjoint. Let's do the same thing for our modelling of things that don't consist of matter and aren't processes.
      - InformationObjects may include embedded data or links to external resources via the url slot
      - May appear as output from a process, inputs into a process, or both
      - All slots relating one class to a InformationObject should be is_a sub-properties of has_input or has_output,
        if they are multivalued or otherwise organized
      - Historically information about many classes has been inlined into the class. This is an alternative pattern.
