  rna_concentration:
    title: RNA concentration in ng/ul
    comments:
      - Units must be in ng/uL. Enter the numerical part only. Must be calculated using
        a fluorometric method. Acceptable values are 0-2000.

    title: RNA container type
    examples:
      - value: plate

    slot_group: JGI-Metatranscriptomics
    range: JgiContTypeEnum
    recommended: true
  rna_cont_well:
    title: RNA plate position
    comments:
      - Required when 'plate' is selected for container type.
      - Leave blank if the sample will be shipped in a tube.
      - JGI will not process samples in corner wells, so A1, A12, H1 and H12 will not
        pass validation.
      - For partial plates, fill by columns, like B1-G1,A2-H2,A3-D3 (NOT A2-A11,B1-B8).
    examples:
      - value: B2
    rank: 11
    string_serialization: '{96 well plate pos}'
    slot_group: JGI-Metatranscriptomics
    recommended: true
    pattern: ^(?!A1$|A12$|H1$|H12$)(([A-H][1-9])|([A-H]1[0-2]))$
  rna_container_id:
    title: RNA container label
    comments:
      - Must be unique across all tubes and plates, and <20 characters. All samples
        in a plate should have the same plate label.
    examples:
      - value: Pond_MT_041618
