          - Aspect is the orientation of slope, measured clockwise in degrees from 0 to 360, where 0 is north-facing, 90 is east-facing, 180 is south-facing, and 270 is west-facing.
        description: The direction a slope faces. While looking down a slope use a compass to record the direction you are facing (direction or degrees).
          - This measure provides an indication of sun and wind exposure that will influence soil temperature and evapotranspiration.

        title: aluminum saturation/ extreme unusual properties

        comments:
          - Aluminum saturation is the percentage of the CEC occupies by aluminum. Like all cations, aluminum held by the cation exchange complex is in equilibrium with aluminum in the soil solution.
        examples:
          - value: 27%
        todos:
          - This is no longer matching the listed IRI from GSC. When NMDC has its own slots, map this to the MIxS slot
          - Example & validation. Can we make rules that 27% & 27 % & 0.27 will validate?
          - I think it's weird the way GSC writes the title. I recommend this change. Thoughts? I would argue this isn't an extreme unusual property. It's just a biogeochemical measurement.

          - For multiple heavy metals and concentrations, separate by ;
        notes:
          - Changed to multi-valued. In MIxS, you add another column to denote multiple heavy metals. We don't have that ability in the submission portal.

        todos:
          - Why is it soil water content method in the name but not the title? Is this slot used in other samples?
          - Soil water content can be measure MANY ways and often, multiple ways are used in one experiment (gravimetric water content and water holding capacity and water filled pore space, to name a few).
          - Should this be multi valued? How to we manage and validate this?

          - value in preferred unit is too limiting. need to change this
          - check and correct validation so examples are accepted
          - This is no longer matching the listed IRI from GSC. When NMDC has its own slots, map this to the MIxS slot
          - how to manage multiple water content methods?

          - is this inorganic and organic? both? could use some clarification.
          - ug/L doesn't seem like the right units. Should check this slots usage in databases and re-evaluate. I couldn't find any references that provided this data in this format

          - Describe how samples were composited or sieved.
          - Use 'sample link' to indicate which samples were combined.
        examples:
          - value: combined 2 cores | 4mm sieved
          - value: 4 mm sieved and homogenized
          - value: 50 g | 5 cores | 2 mm sieved

          - would like to see usage examples for this slot. Requiring micromole/L seems too limiting and doesn't match expected_value value
          - did I do this right? keep the example that's provided and add another? so as to not override

          - value: CO2; 500ppm above ambient; constant
          - value: nitric oxide;0.5 micromole per liter;R2/2018-05-11T14:30/2018-05-11T19:30/P1H30M

        comments:
          - Identifiers must be prefixed. Possible FAIR prefixes are IGSNs (http://www.geosamples.org/getigsn), NCBI biosample accession numbers, ARK identifiers (https://arks.org/). These IDs enable linking to derived analytes and subsamples. If you have not assigned FAIR identifiers to your samples, you can generate UUIDs (https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
        examples:
          - value: IGSN:AU1243
          - value: UUID:24f1467a-40f4-11ed-b878-0242ac120002
        todos:
          - Currently, the comments say to use UUIDs. However, if we implement assigning NMDC identifiers with the minter we dont need to require a GUID. It can be an optional field to fill out only if they already have a resolvable ID.
