  FunctionalAnnotation:
    class_uri: nmdc:FunctionalAnnotation
    description: >-
      An assignment of a function term (e.g. reaction or pathway) that is executed by a gene product, 
      or which the gene product plays an active role in.
      Functional annotations can be assigned manually by curators, or automatically in workflows. 
      In the context of NMDC, all function annotation is performed
      automatically, typically using HMM or Blast type methods

      Typically this is used for a CDS feature or gene feature which will encode a protein.
      It can also be used by a nc transcript ot gene feature that encoded a ncRNA
