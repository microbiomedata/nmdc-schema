  DerivatizationProcess:
    description: >-
      A technique used in chemistry which transforms a chemical compound into a product (the reaction's derivate) of similar chemical structure, called a derivative. That compound has properties more amenable to a particular analytical method. Some samples analyzed by GC require derivatization in order to make them suitable for analysis. Compounds that have poor volatility, poor thermal stability, or that can be adsorbed in the injector will exhibit nonreproducible peak areas, heights, and shapes. Other compounds that respond poorly on a specific detector may need to be “tagged” with a different functional group to improve detection.
