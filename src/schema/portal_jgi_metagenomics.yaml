  dna_collect_site:
    description: Provide information on the site your DNA sample was collected from
    title: DNA collection site
    examples:
      - value: untreated pond water
    rank: 15
    string_serialization: '{text}'
    slot_group: JGI-Metagenomics
    recommended: true

  dna_cont_type:
    description: Tube or plate (96-well)
    title: DNA container type
    examples:
      - value: plate
    rank: 10
    slot_group: JGI-Metagenomics
    range: JgiContTypeEnum
    recommended: true
  dna_cont_well:
    title: DNA plate position
    comments:
      - Required when 'plate' is selected for container type.
      - Leave blank if the sample will be shipped in a tube.
      - JGI will not process samples in corner wells, so A1, A12, H1 and H12 will not pass validation.
      - For partial plates, fill by columns, like B1-G1,A2-H2,A3-D3 (NOT A2-A11,B1-B8).
    examples:
      - value: B2
    rank: 11
    string_serialization: '{96 well plate pos}'
    slot_group: JGI-Metagenomics
    recommended: true
    pattern: ^(?!A1$|A12$|H1$|H12$)(([A-H][1-9])|([A-H]1[0-2]))$
  dna_container_id:
    title: DNA container label
    comments:
      - Must be unique across all tubes and plates, and <20 characters. All samples
        in a plate should have the same plate label.
    examples:
      - value: Pond_MT_041618
    rank: 9
    string_serialization: '{text < 20 characters}'
    slot_group: JGI-Metagenomics
    recommended: true
  dna_dnase:
    title: DNase treatment DNA
    comments:
      - Note DNase treatment is required for all RNA samples.
    examples:
      - value: 'no'
    rank: 13
    slot_group: JGI-Metagenomics
    range: YesNoEnum
    recommended: true
  dna_isolate_meth:

      - value: phenol/chloroform extraction
    rank: 16
    string_serialization: '{text}'
    slot_group: JGI-Metagenomics
    recommended: true
    aliases:

  dna_organisms:
    description: List any organisms known or suspected to grow in co-culture, as well
      as estimated % of the organism in that culture.
    title: DNA expected organisms
    examples:
      - value: expected to contain microbes (59%) fungi (30%), viruses (10%), tadpoles
          (1%)
    rank: 14
    string_serialization: '{text}'

  dna_samp_id:
    title: DNA sample ID
    todos:
      - Removed identifier = TRUE from dna_samp_ID in JGI_sample_slots, as a class can't
        have two identifiers. How to force uniqueness? Moot because that column will
        be prefilled?
