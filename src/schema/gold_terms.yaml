    abstract: true
    description: >-
      This is a grouping for any of the gold path fields
  ecosystem:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description: An ecosystem is a combination of a physical environment (abiotic
      factors) and all the organisms (biotic factors) that interact with this environment.
      Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments: The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition
      of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level
      classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which
      an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under
      Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent
      samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from
      engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.

  ecosystem_category:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description: Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based
      on specific characteristics of the environment from where an organism or sample
      is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments: The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic
      and Terrestrial. Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual
      hosts or phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments
      like bioreactors, solid waste etc.

  ecosystem_type:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description: Ecosystem types represent things having common characteristics within
      the Ecosystem Category. These common characteristics based grouping is still
      broad but specific to the characteristics of a given environment. Ecosystem
      type is in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments: The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types
      like Marine or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air
      or Outdoor air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated
      samples, ecosystem type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system,
      Roots etc.

  ecosystem_subtype:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description: Ecosystem subtypes represent further subdivision of Ecosystem types
      into more distinct subtypes. Ecosystem subtype is in position 4/5 in a GOLD
      path.
    comments: Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further
      divided (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone
      etc. in the Ecosystem subtype category.

  specific_ecosystem:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description: Specific ecosystems represent specific features of the environment
      like aphotic zone in an ocean or gastric mucosa within a host digestive system.
      Specific ecosystem is in position 5/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments: Specific ecosystems help to define samples based on very specific characteristics
      of an environment under the five-level classification system.
