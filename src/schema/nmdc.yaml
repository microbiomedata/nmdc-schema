notes:
  - "informal ## section delimiters should be replaced with subsets ?"
  - "commented out insdc_biosample_identifiers insdc_secondary_sample_identifiers... need better understanding of id patterns (at least)"
  - not importing any MIxS terms where the relationship between the name (SCN) and the id isn't 1:1

  Schema for National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC).

  This schema is organized into multiple modules, such as:

   * a set of core types for representing data values
   * a subset of the mixs schema
   * an annotation schema
   * the NMDC schema itself, into which the other modules are imported

    comments:
      - Schema authors are responsible for alerting and supporting Kitware and nmdc-server authors about changes they will have to make if entities labeled with data_portal_subset are modified.
      - Assignment of the data_portal_subset is incomplete in the schema.

          The direction a slope faces. While looking down a slope use a compass to record the direction you are facing (direction or degrees).

        title: aluminum saturation/ extreme unusual properties
        description: The relative abundance of aluminum in the sample
        comments:
          - Aluminum saturation is the percentage of the CEC occupies by aluminum. Like all cations, aluminum held by the cation exchange complex is in equilibrium with aluminum in the soil solution.
        examples:
          - value: 27%
        todos:
          - This is no longer matching the listed IRI from GSC. When NMDC has its own slots, map this to the MIxS slot
          - Example & validation. Can we make rules that 27% & 27 % & 0.27 will validate?
          - I think it's weird the way GSC writes the title. I recommend this change. Thoughts? I would argue this isn't an extreme unusual property. It's just a biogeochemical measurement.

        comments:
          - Identifiers must be prefixed. Possible FAIR prefixes are IGSNs (http://www.geosamples.org/getigsn), NCBI biosample accession numbers, ARK identifiers (https://arks.org/). These IDs enable linking to derived analytes and subsamples. If you have not assigned FAIR identifiers to your samples, you can generate UUIDs (https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
        examples:
          - value: IGSN:AU1243
          - value: UUID:24f1467a-40f4-11ed-b878-0242ac120002
        todos:
          - Currently, the comments say to use UUIDs. However, if we implement assigning NMDC identifiers with the minter we dont need to require a GUID. It can be an optional field to fill out only if they already have a resolvable ID.

        (b) an individual unit of the lot taken as part of the sample; (c) the final unit of multistage sampling.
        The term 'subsample' is used either in the sense of a 'sample of a sample' or as a synonym for 'unit'.
        In practice, the meaning is usually apparent from the context or is defined.

  ## GOLD PATHS

    description: >-
      This is a grouping for any of the gold path fields
  ecosystem:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      An ecosystem is a combination of a physical environment (abiotic
      factors) and all the organisms (biotic factors) that interact with this environment.
      Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition
      of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level
      classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which
      an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under
      Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent
      samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from
      engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  ecosystem_category:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based
      on specific characteristics of the environment from where an organism or sample
      is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic
      and Terrestrial. Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual
      hosts or phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments
      like bioreactors, solid waste etc.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  ecosystem_type:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem types represent things having common characteristics within
      the Ecosystem Category. These common characteristics based grouping is still
      broad but specific to the characteristics of a given environment. Ecosystem
      type is in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types
      like Marine or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air
      or Outdoor air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated
      samples, ecosystem type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system,
      Roots etc.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  ecosystem_subtype:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem subtypes represent further subdivision of Ecosystem types
      into more distinct subtypes. Ecosystem subtype is in position 4/5 in a GOLD
      path.
    comments:
      Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further
      divided (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone
      etc. in the Ecosystem subtype category.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  specific_ecosystem:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Specific ecosystems represent specific features of the environment
      like aphotic zone in an ocean or gastric mucosa within a host digestive system.
      Specific ecosystem is in position 5/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      Specific ecosystems help to define samples based on very specific characteristics
      of an environment under the five-level classification system.
