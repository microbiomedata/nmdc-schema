  Schema for National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC).
  This schem is organized into 3 separate modules:
    
  This schema is organized into distinct modules:
    
   * a set of core types for representing data values
   * the mixs schema (auto-translated from mixs excel)
   * annotation schema
   * the NMDC schema itself
