title: NMDC Schema
notes:
- MetaCyc expansion assumes we're talking about metacyc reactions and not genes, compounds
  etc.
- removed/commented out the confusing 'identifier' slot
- removed/commented out all mentions and definitions of depth2 and subsurface_depth2
- depth2 should now be migrated to the has_maximum_value part of depth
- 'slots requested for Bioscales, but already available for Biosample : tot_phosp,
  tot_carb, tot_nitro_content, pH'
- 'informal ## section delimiters should be replaced with subsets ?'
- commented out insdc_biosample_identifiers insdc_secondary_sample_identifiers...
  need better understanding of id patterns (at least)
- commented out several MIxS terms assigned to Biosample because the definitions of
  those terms were commented out in mixs.yaml dues to shared slot uris
- resuming use of part_of to link Biosamples to Studies. eg releasing sample_link
  from that role

    - Provides grouping of biosamples at level that's more specific than belonging
      to the same study
    - be very clear that this could be part of a larger site
    - In Bioscales, one might say that rhizosphere soil and bulk soil from around
      the same plant were obtained at the same site. In this case, the site would
      correspond to one tree.

      Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments: The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition
      of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level
      classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which
      an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under
      Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent
      samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from
      engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.

  ecosystem_category:

    description: Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based

      is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments: The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic
      and Terrestrial. Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual
      hosts or phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments
      like bioreactors, solid waste etc.

  ecosystem_type:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description: Ecosystem types represent things having common characteristics within
      the Ecosystem Category. These common characteristics based grouping is still
      broad but specific to the characteristics of a given environment. Ecosystem
      type is in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments: The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types
      like Marine or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air
      or Outdoor air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated
      samples, ecosystem type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system,
      Roots etc.

    comments: Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further
      divided (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone
      etc. in the Ecosystem subtype category.

    comments: Specific ecosystems help to define samples based on very specific characteristics
      of an environment under the five-level classification system.
