        comments:
        - Aspect is the orientation of slope, measured clockwise in degrees from 0
          to 360, where 0 is north-facing, 90 is east-facing, 180 is south-facing,
          and 270 is west-facing.
        description: The direction a slope faces. While looking down a slope use a
          compass to record the direction you are facing (direction or degrees). -
          This measure provides an indication of sun and wind exposure that will influence
          soil temperature and evapotranspiration.

        comments:
        - Identifiers must be prefixed. Possible FAIR prefixes are IGSNs (http://www.geosamples.org/getigsn),
          NCBI biosample accession numbers, ARK identifiers (https://arks.org/). These
          IDs enable linking to derived analytes and subsamples. If you have not assigned
          FAIR identifiers to your samples, you can generate UUIDs (https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).

        todos:
        - Currently, the comments say to use UUIDs. However, if we implement assigning
          NMDC identifiers with the minter we don't need to require a GUID. It can
          be an optional field to fill out only if they already have a resolvable
          ID.
        - this is at least on of the unique identifier column in the Data Portal interface,
          but it can't be a second identifier slot along with Biosample.id in the
          schema

    - In Bioscales, one might say that rhizosphere soil and bulk soil from around
      the same plant were obtained at the same site. In this case, the site would
      correspond to one tree.

notes:
- MetaCyc expansion assumes we're talking about metacyc reactions and not genes, compounds
  etc.
- removed/commented out the confusing 'identifier' slot
- removed/commented out all mentions and definitions of depth2 and subsurface_depth2
- depth2 should now be migrated to the has_maximum_value part of depth
- 'slots requested for Bioscales, but already available for Biosample : tot_phosp,
  tot_carb, tot_nitro_content, pH'
- 'informal ## section delimiters should be replaced with subsets ?'
- commented out insdc_biosample_identifiers insdc_secondary_sample_identifiers...
  need better understanding of id patterns (at least)
- commented out several MIxS terms assigned to Biosample because the definitions of
  those terms were commented out in mixs.yaml dues to shared slot uris
- resuming use of part_of to link Biosamples to Studies. eg releasing sample_link
  from that role

  ecosystem:
    comments: The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition
      of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level
      classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which
      an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under
      Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent
      samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from
      engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.
    description: An ecosystem is a combination of a physical environment (abiotic
      factors) and all the organisms (biotic factors) that interact with this environment.
      Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.

  ecosystem_category:
    comments: The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic
      and Terrestrial. Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual
      hosts or phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments
      like bioreactors, solid waste etc.
    description: Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based
      on specific characteristics of the environment from where an organism or sample
      is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.

      or Outdoor air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated
      samples, ecosystem type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system,
      Roots etc.
    description: Ecosystem types represent things having common characteristics within
      the Ecosystem Category. These common characteristics based grouping is still
