  Schema for National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC).

  This schema is organized into multiple modules, such as:

   * a set of core types for representing data values
   * a subset of the mixs schema
   * an annotation schema
   * the NMDC schema itself, into which the other modules are imported

    notes:
      - A subsample may be (a) a portion of the sample obtained by selection or division;
        (b) an individual unit of the lot taken as part of the sample; (c) the final unit of multistage sampling.
        The term 'subsample' is used either in the sense of a 'sample of a sample' or as a synonym for 'unit'.
        In practice, the meaning is usually apparent from the context or is defined.

    comments:
      - The mixing may be achieved manually or mechanically by shifting the material with stirrers or pumps
        or by revolving or shaking the container.
      - The process must not permit segregation of particles of different size or properties.
      - Homogeneity may be considered to have been achieved in a practical sense when the sampling error
        of the processed portion is negligible compared to the total error of the measurement system.

Ions are coherently excited to a larger radius orbit using a pulse of radio frequency energy and their image charge is detected on receiver plates as a time domain signal. Fourier transformation of the time domain signal results in a frequency domain signal which is converted to a mass spectrum based in the inverse relationship between frequency and m/z.

  ## GOLD PATHS
  gold_path_field:
    range: string
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      This is a grouping for any of the gold path fields
    annotations:
      tooltip:
        tag: tooltip
        value: GOLD Ecosystem Classification paths describe the surroundings from which an environmental sample or an organism is collected.
        annotations:
          source: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/ecosystem_classification
  ecosystem:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      An ecosystem is a combination of a physical environment (abiotic
      factors) and all the organisms (biotic factors) that interact with this environment.
      Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      - The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition
        of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level
        classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which
        an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under
        Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent
        samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from
        engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.

  ecosystem_category:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based
      on specific characteristics of the environment from where an organism or sample
      is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      - The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic
        and Terrestrial. Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual
        hosts or phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments
        like bioreactors, solid waste etc.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  ecosystem_type:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem types represent things having common characteristics within
      the Ecosystem Category. These common characteristics based grouping is still
      broad but specific to the characteristics of a given environment. Ecosystem
      type is in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      - The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types
        like Marine or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air
        or Outdoor air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated
        samples, ecosystem type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system,
        Roots etc.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  ecosystem_subtype:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Ecosystem subtypes represent further subdivision of Ecosystem types
      into more distinct subtypes. Ecosystem subtype is in position 4/5 in a GOLD
      path.
    comments:
      - Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further
        divided (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone
        etc. in the Ecosystem subtype category.
    see_also: https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
  specific_ecosystem:
    is_a: gold_path_field
    description:
      Specific ecosystems represent specific features of the environment
      like aphotic zone in an ocean or gastric mucosa within a host digestive system.
      Specific ecosystem is in position 5/5 in a GOLD path.
    comments:
      - Specific ecosystems help to define samples based on very specific characteristics
        of an environment under the five-level classification system.

    comments:
      - "Filters are made with a variety of materials: cellulose and derivatives, glass fibre, ceramic, synthetic plastics and fibres. Filters may be naturally porous or be made so by mechanical or other means. Membrane/ceramic filters are prepared with highly controlled pore size in a sheet of suitable material such as polyfluoroethylene, polycarbonate or cellulose esters. Nylon mesh is sometimes used for reinforcement. The pores constitute 80–85% of the filter volume commonly and several pore sizes are available for air sampling (0.45−0.8 μm are commonly employed)."
