jgi_genome_portal_identifiers: # this slot is not defined
 - https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/BioDefcarcycling/BioDefcarcycling.info.html
# maybe "other data links" instead?
# could be links to raw data or analysis results
# NMDC is *not* using the data in these slots
# not a research project/summary page
# these links should be checked outside of (or ideally) LinkML
# would these always be displayed on the Data Portal?
# separate slots for the following, (so icon could be displayed) ?
 #   JGI Genome Portal,
 #   GNPS processed metabolomics,
 #   EMSL study & samples
 # and others
# can we put parameterization into curie prefix expansions
# maybe we should just replicate at lest the spirit of the https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/external_database_identifiers/
# see https://data.microbiomedata.org/details/study/nmdc:sty-11-r2h77870
