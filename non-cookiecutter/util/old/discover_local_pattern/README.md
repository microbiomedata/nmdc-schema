## Notebooks related to nmdc-schema ID validation
_And some related general purpose YAML/linkml notebooks developed arround the same time._

- discover_kegg_local_pattern.ipynb
    - data-driven discovery of KEGG orthology pattern
    - can use https://bioregistry.io/registry/kegg.orthology instead
- eggnog_id_pattern_discovery.ipynb
    - So much variability. No consistent over time/versions. Might be hard to do from a data dependent approach.
    - can use https://bioregistry.io/registry/eggnog instead
- id_validation_opportunities.ipynb
    - **This might be the most relevant notebook for other people to run.**
    - a listing of nmdc-schema `.yaml` files that define ID prefixes and might therefore need validataion
- plot_linkml_imports.ipynb
    - Not really NMDC or pattern related. Just a minimal attempt to understand the nmdc-schema imports.
