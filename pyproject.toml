# scripts should be listed here in tool.poetry.scripts
# use underscores to delimit file name
# use hyphens to delimit CLI alias
# scripts/aliases should be illustrated in a Makefile
# Makefile targets should make use of $< etc for input and $@ for output
# input and output files should use hyphens as delimters in their names

# be intentional about output: most should go in assets unless its really large or likely to change independently of the schema, like MOngoDB summaries
# cli entry points should probably all be main or cli unless there's a compelling reason to do otherwise
