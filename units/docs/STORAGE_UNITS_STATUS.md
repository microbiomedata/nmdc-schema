**Date Generated:** 2025-01-23  
**Repository:** nmdc-schema  
**Branch Analyzed:** `2598-add-storage_units-annotations-to-quantityvalue-slots-that-only-have-one-clear-cut-mixs---ucum-mapping`  
**Primary Issue:** [#2598](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/issues/2598)

## Executive Summary

This document provides a complete status report on the `storage_units` annotation work for QuantityValue slots in the NMDC schema. The work is being conducted in two phases, with Phase 1 completed but not yet merged to main.

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Pending

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: COMPLETED (Not Yet Merged)
**Scope:** Add `storage_units` annotations to QuantityValue slots that have MIxS `preferred_unit` annotations

- **Branch:** `2598-add-storage_units-annotations-to-quantityvalue-slots-that-only-have-one-clear-cut-mixs---ucum-mapping`
- **Status:** Complete, under review in [PR #2599](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-schema/pull/2599)
- **Slots Handled:** 159 QuantityValue slots with clear MIxS ‚Üí UCUM mappings
- **Lead:** turbomam (Mark Andrew Miller)

### üîÑ Phase 2: NEXT TASK (This Document's Focus)
**Scope:** Add `storage_units` annotations to QuantityValue slots WITHOUT MIxS `preferred_unit` annotations

- **Slots to Handle:** 29 QuantityValue slots without preferred_unit annotations
- **Challenge:** No MIxS guidance - must determine appropriate UCUM units independently

## Contributors and Parallel Work

### Primary Implementation
- **turbomam (Mark Andrew Miller):** Lead on storage_units annotation implementation

## Verified Data Analysis

### Total QuantityValue Slots in Schema: 188
**Verification Date:** 2025-01-23  
**Source:** `nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml` (feature branch)

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| WITH storage_units | 161 | ‚úÖ 85.6% Complete |
| WITHOUT storage_units | 27 | üîÑ 14.4% Remaining |
| **TOTAL** | **188** | **Sum Verified ‚úì** |

## Quick Discovery Commands

### yq Commands for Analysis

```bash
# Find QuantityValue slots WITH storage_units annotations
yq '.slots | to_entries | map(select(.value.range == "QuantityValue" and .value.annotations.storage_units)) | .[].key' nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml

# Count QuantityValue slots WITH storage_units
yq '.slots | to_entries | map(select(.value.range == "QuantityValue" and .value.annotations.storage_units)) | length' nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml

# Find QuantityValue slots WITHOUT storage_units (shows slots missing storage_units)
yq '.slots | to_entries | map(select(.value.range == "QuantityValue")) | .[] | .key + " | " + (.value.annotations.storage_units.value // "MISSING")' nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml | grep "MISSING"

# Count QuantityValue slots WITHOUT storage_units
yq '.slots | to_entries | map(select(.value.range == "QuantityValue")) | .[] | .key + " | " + (.value.annotations.storage_units.value // "MISSING")' nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml | grep "MISSING" | wc -l

# Complete table of all QuantityValue slots with storage_units status
yq '.slots | to_entries | map(select(.value.range == "QuantityValue")) | .[] | .key + " | " + (.value.annotations.storage_units.value // "MISSING")' nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml | sort
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About yq Queries
The original queries using `(.value.annotations.storage_units | not)` were **incorrect** because `storage_units` is a complex object `{"tag": "storage_units", "value": "..."}`, not a simple value. Use the corrected queries above.

### Python Analysis Script
```bash
# Generate comprehensive preferred units report
cd src/scripts && poetry run python analyze_preferred_units.py -s ../../nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml
```

## Remaining Work: 27 QuantityValue Slots Without storage_units

**Current Status:** 161 slots complete (85.6%), 27 slots remaining (14.4%)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Context: Unit Quality Issues

Several of the remaining slots have been **deliberately avoided** due to documented concerns about unreasonable or inconsistent units in production data. Evidence shows extensive unit validation problems and strategic avoidance of problematic cases.

**Key Issues Identified:**
- **MIxS Internal Inconsistencies**: Some slots have illogical preferred_unit values (e.g., efficiency measured as concentration)
- **UCUM Incompatibilities**: MIxS specifies units not recognized by UCUM standards  
- **Production Data Quality**: Real-world data shows unit mismatches requiring validation infrastructure
- **Strategic Avoidance**: Some slots deliberately given `units_alignment_excuse` annotations instead

The following 27 QuantityValue slots still lack `storage_units` annotations:

```
alt                    # Altitude - needs length unit (m)
api                    # API gravity - needs dimensionless or API unit
biomaterial_purity     # Purity percentage/ratio - needs % or ratio (1)
bulk_elect_conductivity # Electrical conductivity - needs S/m or mS/cm
concentration          # Generic concentration - context dependent
container_size         # Container volume/size - needs volume unit (L, mL)
efficiency_percent     # Efficiency percentage - needs %
exp_pipe               # Pipe measurement - needs area (m2) or length
filter_pore_size       # Filter pore diameter - needs length (um, mm)
freq_clean             # Cleaning frequency - needs frequency (1/d, Hz)
freq_cook              # Cooking frequency - needs frequency (1/d, Hz)
input_volume           # Input volume - needs volume (L, mL)
inside_lux             # Indoor light - needs lux (lx)
max_occup              # Maximum occupancy - needs count (1)
number_pets            # Count of pets - needs count (1)
number_plants          # Count of plants - needs count (1)  
number_resident        # Count of residents - needs count (1)
occup_density_samp     # Occupancy density - needs count per area/volume
occup_samp             # Occupancy sample - needs count (1)
organism_count         # Organism count - needs count (1)
rel_humidity_out       # Relative humidity outside - needs %
room_occup             # Room occupancy - needs count (1)
root_med_ph            # pH measurement - needs dimensionless (1)
soil_text_measure      # Soil texture measurement - context dependent
specific_humidity      # Specific humidity - needs g/kg or ratio
substances_volume      # Volume of substances - needs volume (L, mL)
value                  # Generic value - context dependent
```

### üö´ Deliberately Avoided Slots with units_alignment_excuse

The following slots were **intentionally given excuse annotations instead of storage_units** due to unit quality problems:

**File Evidence:** `assets/pref-unit-slots-claude-ucum-expanded-curated-with-has-problem.tsv`  
**Commit:** `514520a5b` - "down to 8 problematic units"

| Slot | Issue | MIxS Unit Problem | Excuse Category |
|------|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| `efficiency_percent` | MIxS says "micromole per liter" for efficiency % | Unit mismatch - efficiency as concentration? | MIxS internally inconsistent |
| `inside_lux` | MIxS says "kilowatt per square metre" for indoor light | Unit mismatch - lux vs power density | MIxS internally inconsistent |  
| `rel_humidity_out` | MIxS says "gram of air, kilogram of air" for humidity | Humidity should be % not mass ratios | MIxS internally inconsistent |
| `specific_humidity` | MIxS says "gram of air, kilogram of air" for humidity | Humidity should be g/kg not ambiguous ratios | MIxS internally inconsistent |
| `api` | MIxS says "degrees API" | UCUM doesn't recognize "degrees API" unit | UCUM unaware of MIxS unit |
| `permeability` | MIxS says "mD" (millidarcy) | UCUM doesn't support darcy units | UCUM unaware of MIxS unit |

**Strategy**: These slots received `units_alignment_excuse` annotations documenting why they **cannot** receive proper storage_units annotations due to fundamental unit problems.

### üîß Production Data Validation Infrastructure

Extensive validation infrastructure was built to handle unit quality concerns:

**Key Files:**
- `units/validate_production_units.py` - Production data compliance validation
- `units/README.md` - MongoDB production data analysis documentation  
- `tests/test_units_alignment.py` - Test framework for excuse categories
- `assets/pref-unit-slots-claude-ucum-expanded-curated-with-has-problem.tsv` - Comprehensive unit problem catalog

**Approved Excuse Categories:**
```python
APPROVED_UNITS_ALIGNMENT_EXCUSES = {
    "not measurement like",           # For protocol/regimen slots
    "MIxS internally inconsistent",   # For MIxS specification errors
    "UCUM unaware of MIxS unit"      # For non-UCUM units
}
```

This infrastructure allows systematic handling of unit problems while maintaining data validation integrity.

### üìä Real Production Data Examples

**File:** `units/mongodb-slots-to-units_remediated.csv`

**Documented Unit Mismatches in Production Data:**

**Major Category Errors (Wrong Unit Types):**
```
abs_air_humidity,[lb_av]|g/g|kg|kg/kg,kPa,192,invalid,review data - kPa is pressure not humidity
diss_oxygen,mg/L|umol/kg,mL/L,101,invalid,review data - mL/L may be incorrect unit for dissolved oxygen  
salinity,%,mg/L,17,invalid,review data - salinity should be dimensionless (%)
```

**Additional Category Error Examples:**
```
diss_oxygen,mg/L|umol/kg,umol/L,17,invalid,convert data from umol/L to mg/L (multiply by 0.032 for O2)
manganese,[ppm]|mg/kg,mg/L,6,invalid,convert data from mg/L to mg/kg (requires density conversion)
```

**Soil vs Aquatic Context Confusion:**
```
nitro,umol/L,%,919,invalid,review data - % likely correct for soil nitrogen content
org_carb,umol/L,%,1407,invalid,review data - % likely correct for organic carbon content
tot_carb,ug/L,%,192,invalid,review data - % likely correct for total carbon content
tot_nitro_content,mg/L|ug/L|umol/L,%,192,invalid,review data - % likely correct for soil nitrogen content
ammonium_nitrogen,mg/kg,mg/L,1239,invalid,review data - mg/kg expected for soil samples
tot_nitro,mg/L|ug/L|umol/L,%,103,invalid,review data - % likely correct for soil nitrogen content
potassium,[ppm]|mg/L,mg/kg,103,invalid,convert data from mg/kg to mg/L (requires density conversion)
magnesium,[ppm]|mg/L|mol/L|umol/kg,mg/kg,103,invalid,review data - mg/kg common for soil samples
calcium,[ppm]|mg/L|umol/L,mg/kg,103,invalid,convert data from mg/kg to mg/L (requires density conversion)
```

**Unit Scale Mismatches (Same Dimension, Wrong Scale):**
```
conduc,mS/cm,uS/cm,209,invalid,convert data from uS/cm to mS/cm (multiply by 0.001)
density,g/cm3|g/m3,kg/m3,153,invalid,convert data from kg/m3 to g/m3 (multiply by 1000)
humidity,g/m3,%,192,invalid,convert data from % to g/m3 (requires temperature and pressure)
solar_irradiance,erg/cm2/s|kW/m2/d,W/m2,192,invalid,convert data from W/m2 to kW/m2/d (multiply by 0.0864)
diss_org_carb,mg/L|umol/L,ug/L,31,invalid,convert data from ug/L to mg/L (multiply by 0.001)
part_org_carb,ug/L,mg/L,31,invalid,convert data from mg/L to ug/L (multiply by 1000)
part_org_nitro,ug/L|umol/L,mg/L,31,invalid,convert data from mg/L to ug/L (multiply by 1000)
soluble_react_phosp,[ppm]|mg/L|umol/L,ug/L,31,invalid,convert data from ug/L to mg/L (multiply by 0.001)
tot_diss_nitro,ug/L,umol/L,64,invalid,convert data from umol/L to ug/L (requires molecular weight conversion)
diss_inorg_nitro,ug/L|umol/L,mg/L,45,invalid,convert data from mg/L to ug/L (multiply by 1000)
```

**Analysis:** Production data contains **systematic unit quality problems** across multiple categories - wrong unit types (pressure for humidity), context confusion (aquatic vs soil units), and scale mismatches. This justifies the extensive validation infrastructure and cautious approach to storage_units implementation.

**Evidence Sources:**
- `units/production_units_validation.tsv` - Production compliance analysis
- `units/mongodb-slots-to-units.csv` - Raw production unit usage data  
- Slack discussion (Aug 19-20, 2024) - Team review of unit mismatches in api-dev data

This type of data quality issue explains the cautious approach to adding storage_units annotations without thorough validation.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Current Storage Units Pattern (from Phase 1)
```yaml
# Single unit
storage_units: m

# Multiple valid units  
storage_units: "[ppm]|mg/kg|mg/L"

# Percentage
storage_units: '%|mmol/L'

# Mass
storage_units: g
```

### Validation Requirements
1. All `storage_units` values must be valid UCUM expressions
2. All `storage_units` values must exist in `UnitEnum`
3. Data validation ensures `has_unit` values comply with `storage_units` constraints
4. Migration tools (samobermiller's work) ensure existing data compliance

## Phase 2 Unit Assignment Strategy

### Recommended Approach for 29 Remaining Slots

1. **Obvious Physical Quantities:**
   - `temperature` ‚Üí `Cel` (Celsius)
   - `mass`, `input_mass` ‚Üí `g` (grams)
   - `volume`, `input_volume`, `container_size`, `substances_volume` ‚Üí `L` (liters)
   - `depth`, `subsurface_depth`, `alt` ‚Üí `m` (meters)
   - `duration` ‚Üí `s` (seconds) or context-dependent

2. **Ratios and Dimensionless:**
   - `carb_nitro_ratio` ‚Üí `1` (dimensionless)
   - `biomaterial_purity` ‚Üí `%` (percentage)

3. **Counts:**
   - `number_pets`, `number_plants`, `number_resident` ‚Üí `1` (dimensionless count)
   - `max_occup`, `room_occup`, `occup_samp` ‚Üí `1` (dimensionless count)

4. **Context-Dependent (Research Needed):**
   - `concentration` ‚Üí depends on what's being measured
   - `bulk_elect_conductivity` ‚Üí electrical conductivity units (S/m?)
   - `filter_pore_size` ‚Üí length units (Œºm?)
   - `freq_clean`, `freq_cook` ‚Üí frequency units (1/d?)
   - `occup_density_samp` ‚Üí occupancy per area/volume
   - `root_med_ph` ‚Üí `1` (pH is dimensionless)
   - `soil_text_measure` ‚Üí context-dependent
   - `exp_pipe` ‚Üí length measurement
   - `value` ‚Üí generic, context-dependent

## Project Coordination

### No New Issue Needed
- **Issue #2598** scope can be expanded to include Phase 2 work
- Current issue assignment and ownership patterns should continue

### Coordination with samobermiller
- Validation work (PR #2641) should be coordinated with Phase 2 implementation
- Migration tools need to handle the new storage_units annotations

## Next Steps

1. **Determine storage_units values** for the 29 identified slots
2. **Implement annotations** in schema files (extend current branch or new branch)
3. **Coordinate with samobermiller** on validation/migration impact
4. **Update test data** to comply with new storage_units constraints
5. **Test UCUM and UnitEnum compliance** for all new annotations
