    evapotranspiration.
  comments:
  - Aspect is the orientation of slope, measured clockwise in degrees from 0 to 360,
    where 0 is north-facing, 90 is east-facing, 180 is south-facing, and 270 is west-facing.

    I would argue this isn't an extreme unusual property. It's just a biogeochemical
    measurement.
  notes:
  - Aluminum saturation is the percentage of the CEC occupies by aluminum. Like all

  description: A globally unique identifier assigned to the biological sample.
  title: source material identifier
  todos:
  - Currently, the comments say to use UUIDs. However, if we implement assigning NMDC
    identifiers with the minter we dont need to require a GUID. It can be an optional
    field to fill out only if they already have a resolvable ID.
  comments:
  - Identifiers must be prefixed. Possible FAIR prefixes are IGSNs (http://www.geosamples.org/getigsn),
    NCBI biosample accession numbers, ARK identifiers (https://arks.org/). These IDs
    enable linking to derived analytes and subsamples. If you have not assigned FAIR
    identifiers to your samples, you can generate UUIDs (https://www.uuidgenerator.net/).
  examples:
  - value: IGSN:AU1243
  - value: UUID:24f1467a-40f4-11ed-b878-0242ac120002
