Filters are made with a variety of materials: cellulose and derivatives, glass fibre, ceramic, synthetic plastics and fibres. Filters may be naturally porous or be made so by mechanical or other means. Membrane/ceramic filters are prepared with highly controlled pore size in a sheet of suitable material such as polyfluoroethylene, polycarbonate or cellulose esters. Nylon mesh is sometimes used for reinforcement. The pores constitute 80Ð85% of the filter volume commonly and several pore sizes are available for air sampling (0.45_0.8 _m are commonly employed)."
