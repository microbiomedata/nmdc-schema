notes:
  - removed several MIxS terms/slots that were sharing slot uris; commented out Biosample assignments
  - note that the NMDC submission schema in sheets_and_friends takes its MIxS terms
    from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenomicsStandardsConsortium/mixs/main/model/schema/mixs.yaml
    and then potentially modifies them. Ideally this file would contain MIxS terms, essentially ready-to-use
  - multiple LinkML representations of MIxS are currently available and one will be blessed soon
