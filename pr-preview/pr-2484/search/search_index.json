By establishing a structured approach to metadata, the NMDC Schema enables researchers to organize,  share, and interpret complex datasets with consistency and clarity. The NMDC Schema is critical substrate used to facilitate  interoperability and collaboration, as it provide a common language for data exchange across systems and disciplines.  In the context of the NMDC, this schema supports the integration of microbiome data from medicine, agriculture,  bioenergy, and environmental science into a cohesive platform.</p> <p>This schema is organized into two modules:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A core set of elements for representing data values represented in LinkML format (https://w3id.org/linkml/) consisting of a set classes, slots, types, and enumerations that are used to define the structure of the NMDC schema.</p> </li> <li> <p>A subset of the MIxS schema developed by the Genomic Standards Consortium, that is used to describe the environmental context of samples.</p> </li> </ul> <p>URI: https://w3id.org/nmdc/nmdc</p>"},{"location":"#classes","title":"Classes","text":"Class Description AttributeValue The value for any value of a attribute for a sample ControlledTermValue A controlled term or class from an ontology ControlledIdentifiedTermValue A controlled term or class from an ontology, requiring the presence of term w...

If you are unfamiliar with these types of metadata (Figure 1), we recommend you begin with an Introduction to Metadata and Ontologies: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Metadata and Ontologies (But Were Afraid to Ask) (https://doi.org/10.25979/1607365).</p> <p>Figure 1: Microbiome metadata types: Information that contextualizes sample including its geographic location and collection date, sample preparation, data processing methods, and data products produced from a biological sample (Luke et al., 2020.

DOI: 10.25979/1607365).</p> <p>All data integrated into the NMDC data portal must adhere to existing metadata standards for proper indexing and display, and to ensure accurate search results are returned. This documentation outlines the standards and ontologies that were included in the NMDC data schema, a framework that defines how data were defined and linked. For the 2019-2022 pilot initiative, the NMDC Metadata Standards Team (see the NMDC Team page) leveraged existing community-driven standards developed by the Genomics Standards Consortium (GSC), the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Genomes Online Database (GOLD), and OBO Foundry\u2019s Environmental Ontology (EnvO). In collaboration with these organizations, the NMDC has created a framework for mapping these standards into an interoperable framework that can be expanded to include additional standards and ontologies in the future.</p> <p>Additional information on the activities by the NMDC Metadata Standards team can be found on the NMDC website at: https://microbiomedata.org/metadata/</p>"},{"location":"Metadata_Documentation_Overview/#standards-and-ontologies-used-by-the-nmdc","title":"Standards and Ontologies used by the NMDC","text":""},{"location":"Metadata_Documentation_Overview/#sample-metadata","title":"Sample Metadata","text":""},{"location":"Metadata_Documentation_Overview/#gsc-minimum-information-about-any-x-sequence-mixs","title":"GSC Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS)","text":"<p>The GSC has developed standards for describing genomic and metagenomic sequences, including the \u201cminimum information about a genome sequence\u201d (MIGS), the \u201cminimum information about a metagenome sequence\u201d (MIMS), and the \u201cminimum information about a marker gene sequence\u201d (MIMARKS). To complement this community-driven standard effort, the GSC has also developed a system for describing the environment from which a biological sample originates, as \u201cenvironmental packages\u201d and established a unified standard set of checklists through the minimum information about any (x) sequence (MIxS).

LBL, which hosts  the <code>id</code> minting endpoint will use one shoulder value. If another organization, like JGI or EMSL, needs to bulk-create <code>id</code>s outside of the central identifier minting endpoint, they would use different shoulders, to be determined by the  NMDC Schema and metadata team.</p>"},{"location":"identifiers/#annotation-identifiers","title":"Annotation identifiers","text":"<p>Both metaG and metaT analyses produce GFF3 files.

You could create <code>wikidata_place_of_birth</code> and  <code>dbpedia_place_of_birth</code> slots and add annotations to the slot to aid in external lookups, but that isn't a good practice if supporting several external targets. A better practice is to have one <code>place_of_birth</code> slot, with the <code>uriorcuire</code> range. Then users can provide values like <code>&lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland&gt;</code>.

That degradation can be difficult to debug.</p> <p>Mike Farrah's yq is a system dependency for the nmdc-schema. It can be used to validate legacy YAML and JSON data.

If you aren't comfortable editing LinkML YAML, then you can get help from one of the schema developers. We recommend filing a new ticket explaining the issue. Please include your error messages.</p> <p>For 2, we suggest taking a minimal example approach. <code>linkml-validate</code> is very good at identifying schema violations in small, syntactically valid data files. Debugging can be aided in pulling out single data instances and first verifying that they are syntactically valid YAML or JSON. If you don't want to use yq, then you could paste one instance into a website like https://jsonlint.com/. A common issue in multi-instance files is using incorrect syntax for grouping the instances into a YAML or JSON array.

If they don't, they inherit the schema's default_range, which is <code>string</code> in the nmdc-schema.</p> <p>LinkML is able to validate that a slot, used in a data source (file or database collection), is populated with an entity of the right type (i.e. is in range) in almost all cases. Unfortunately, one of the cases that currently can not be validated is extremely important to NMDC: checking the data populated into a slot whose range is a non-inlined class. This case can also be described as the slot mentioning an instance of a class by reference. For the record, this requires that the mentioned class has an identifying slot of its own. An example of this is the associated_studies slot in the <code>Biosample</code> class, which has the <code>Study</code> class as its range. The definition of <code>associated_studies</code> does not assert <code>inlined</code> or <code>inlined_as_list</code> to be true, and the <code>Study</code> class inherits the id slot as an identifier from NamedThing. Therefore, the value of an <code>associated_studies</code> slot in a data file must be the <code>id</code> of a <code>Study</code>.</p> <p>In the absense of any other data or constraints, the nmdc-schema will consider the following assertion valid for a <code>Biosample</code>, even if <code>xyz</code> isn't defined in the same data source:</p> <pre><code>associated_studies:\n  - xyz\n</code></pre> <p>If <code>xyz</code> is defined in the data source and it does not pass validation as a <code>Study</code>, then the <code>Biosample</code> will also be considered invalid. Unfortunately, the definitions and mentions of nmdc-schema instances are frequently split across different MongoDB collections, so validating that a referred instance is really of the right type is non-trivial.</p> <p>As a very lightweight guard against referring to instances of the wrong type, <code>stuctured_pattern</code>s were added to <code>slot_usage</code>s in berkeley-schema-fy24, and also independently in nmdc-schema v10 during the development of berkeley-schema-fy24/v11. In addition to being incomplete, this solution introduces some minor problems into the schema, and it relies on some other advanced LinkML features. Still, it has been useful in debugging some schema/data problems that slipped though the cracks in the past.</p> <p>For example, the following can be found inside of <code>Biosample</code>'s <code>slot_usage</code> block now:</p> <pre><code>      associated_studies:\n        required: true\n        range: Study\n        structured_pattern:\n          syntax: \"{id_nmdc_prefix}:sty-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$\"\n          interpolated: true\n</code></pre> <p>That means that the value after <code>associated_studies:</code> in a <code>Biosample</code> must be the <code>id</code> of a <code>Study</code> instance, but also must be a string matching some pattern. The pattern is only revealed if all of the <code>syntax</code> elements in curly brackets are defined in the <code>settings</code> block of the schema, and if the schema has been fed though the <code>gen-likml</code> command line too with <code>--materialize-patterns</code> enabled. In the <code>nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml</code> schema, one can see the intended pattern:</p> <pre><code>      associated_studies:\n        name: associated_studies\n        range: Study\n        required: true\n        pattern: ^(nmdc):sty-([0-9][a-z]{0,6}[0-9])-([A-Za-z0-9]{1,})$\n        structured_pattern:\n          syntax: '{id_nmdc_prefix}:sty-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$'\n          interpolated: true\n</code></pre> <p>Therefore, when using <code>nmdc_schema/nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml</code> for validation, a <code>Biosample</code> with this assertion:</p> <pre><code>associated_studies:\n  - xyz\n</code></pre> <p>would fail validation, because <code>'xyz' does not match '^(nmdc):sty-([0-9][a-z]{0,6}[0-9])-([A-Za-z0-9]{1,})$'</code> (See https://regexr.com/87a0s). NMDC's use of <code>structured_pattern</code> <code>slot_usage</code>s is a manual effort to align the <code>id</code> pattern specified in a class's definition with a constraint on how identifiers for instances of that class are mentioned in a slot.</p> <p>Now that we have addressed <code>structured_pattern</code>s including <code>settings</code> and <code>gen-linkml</code>, let's address <code>slot_usage</code>s, which are attributes of LinkML classes that are intended to refine the behavior of slots, relative to their global definition within the schema. For example, here's the global definition of <code>has_input</code>:</p> <pre><code>  has_input:\n    aliases:\n      - input\n    range: NamedThing\n    multivalued: true\n    description: &gt;-\n      An input to a process.\n</code></pre> <p>The only constraint is that the value of <code>has_input</code> must be the <code>id</code> of a <code>NamedThing</code>, since <code>has_input</code> doesn't assert <code>inlined</code> or <code>inlined_as_list</code>, and <code>NamedThing</code> used <code>id</code> as it's identifying slot. As previously mentioned, <code>structured_pattern</code>s can be used to improve the validation of this slot in some circumstances, but there are multiple classes that use <code>has_input</code>, and they don't all use the same range for <code>has_input</code>. For example, CollectingBiosamplesFromSite specifies that it's range for <code>has_input</code> is <code>Site</code>. Note that not all nmdc-schema contributors are in favor of those semantics.</p> <pre><code>  has_input:\n    range: Site\n    description: &gt;-\n      The site from which samples are collected.\n</code></pre> <p>That <code>slot_usage</code> does not assert a <code>structured_pattern</code>, but many of them do. There are also classes that use <code>has_input</code> without any <code>range</code> constraint in their <code>slot_usage</code>, but might be clearer if they did. For example, WorkflowExecution should probably specify that it only uses DataObject in the range of its <code>has_input</code>. This would provide useful clarity to diagramming tools like refgraph.</p> <p>Finally, we should point out that some <code>slot_usage</code> <code>range</code>s in nmdc-schema use the LinkML <code>any_of</code> construct. For example, here's part of the <code>slot_usage</code> for MaterialProcessing:</p> <pre><code>      has_input:\n        any_of:\n          - range: Biosample\n          - range: ProcessedSample\n        structured_pattern:\n          syntax: \"{id_nmdc_prefix}:(bsm|procsm)-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$\"\n          interpolated: true\n</code></pre> <p>That might be seen as asserting that <code>MaterialProcessing</code>'s <code>range</code> is either <code>Biosample</code> or <code>ProcessedSample</code>, but <code>has_input</code> has the global <code>range</code> of <code>NamedThing</code>, so the effective range for <code>has_input</code> in <code>MaterialProcessing</code> is the union of <code>NamedThing</code>, <code>Biosample</code> and  <code>ProcessedSample</code>.</p> <p>Note that the <code>slot_usage</code> <code>strucutred_pattern</code> essentially asserts two different <code>strucutured_pattern</code> <code>syntax</code>es, due to the use of the <code>|</code> character: \"{id_nmdc_prefix}:bsm-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$\" for <code>Biosample</code>s and \"{id_nmdc_prefix}:procsm-{id_shoulder}-{id_blade}$\" for <code>ProcessedSample</code>s.</p>"},{"location":"v10-vs-v11-retrospective/#summary-of-challenges","title":"Summary of challenges","text":"<ul> <li>LinkML validation does not guarantee that references have been checked for presence and correct form within a   distributed data ecosystem.</li> <li><code>slot_usage</code> is complex to understand and use.</li> <li><code>structured_pattern</code> requires the definition of <code>settings</code> and pattern materialization with <code>gen-linkml</code> in order to   be useful.</li> <li>LinkML doesn't provide any automation for the alignment of <code>id</code> patterns in class definitions, <code>slot_usage</code> <code>structured_pattern</code>s, and <code>slot_usage</code> <code>range</code>s.</li> <li>A human's refinement- or narrowing-based understanding of <code>any_of</code> <code>range</code>s may not match LinkML's union-based   understanding.</li> <li><code>any_of</code> <code>range</code>s can easily override global slot definitions, when they are meant to refine them (in the spirit of   monotonicity).</li> <li><code>slot_usage</code> <code>structured_pattern</code>s, as used in the nmdc-schema, imply that the ranges of some slots are both a   referred thing (asserted in the <code>range</code>), and a string (by way of the pattern).
