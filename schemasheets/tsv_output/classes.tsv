database		An abstract holder for any set of metadata and data. It does not need to correspond to an actual managed databse top level holder class. When translated to JSON-Schema this is the 'root' object. It should contain pointers to other objects of interest	https://microbiomedata/schema
data object	named thing	An object that primarily consists of symbols that represent information.   Files, records, and omics data are examples of data objects. 	https://microbiomedata/schema
biosample	named thing	A material sample. It may be environmental (encompassing many organisms) or isolate or tissue.   An environmental sample containing genetic material from multiple individuals is commonly referred to as a biosample.	https://microbiomedata/schema
study	named thing	A study summarizes the overall goal of a research initiative and outlines the key objective of its underlying projects.	https://microbiomedata/schema
biosample processing	named thing	A process that takes one or more biosamples as inputs and generates one or as outputs. Examples of outputs include samples cultivated from another sample or data objects created by instruments runs.	https://microbiomedata/schema
omics processing	biosample processing	The methods and processes used to generate omics data from a biosample or organism.	https://microbiomedata/schema
