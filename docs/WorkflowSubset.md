### MagsAnalysisActivity

A workflow execution activity that uses computational binning tools to group assembled contigs into genomes


### MetabolomicsAnalysisActivity

None
### MetagenomeAnnotationActivity

A workflow execution activity that provides functional and structural annotation of assembled metagenome contigs
### MetagenomeAssembly

A workflow execution activity that converts sequencing reads into an assembled metagenome.
### MetagenomeSequencingActivity

Initial sequencing activity that precedes any analysis.  This activity has output(s) that are the raw sequencing data.
### MetaproteomicsAnalysisActivity

None
### MetatranscriptomeActivity

A metatranscriptome activity that e.g. pools assembly and annotation activity.
### MetatranscriptomeAnnotationActivity

None
### MetatranscriptomeAssembly

None


### NomAnalysisActivity

None















### ReadBasedTaxonomyAnalysisActivity

A workflow execution activity that performs taxonomy classification using sequencing reads
### ReadQcAnalysisActivity

A workflow execution activity that performs quality control on raw Illumina reads including quality trimming, artifact removal, linker trimming, adapter trimming, spike-in removal, and human/cat/dog/mouse/microbe contaminant removal








### WorkflowExecutionActivity

Represents an instance of an execution of a particular workflow
