# Metaslot Analysis Contradictions

This document tracks the inconsistencies and waffling in the analysis of metaslots between `nmdc_materialized_patterns.yaml` and source schema files in `src/schema/`.

## My Contradictions:

### 1. **`unique_keys`**
- **Initially said**: Only in materialized file (in my early analysis)
- **Then corrected**: Actually in BOTH files after you questioned it
- **My error**: Bad filtering logic

### 2. **`unique_key_slots`**
- **Initially said** (in "corrected analysis"): Only in materialized file
- **Then the tool showed**: NOT in the "only in materialized" list (implying it's in both)
- **My error**: Changed position without explaining

### 3. **`repr`**
- **Initially**: Never mentioned it
- **Then the tool found**: Only in materialized
- **My error**: Missed it in manual analysis

### 4. **`text`**
- **Initially**: Never mentioned it
- **Then the tool found**: Only in materialized
- **My error**: Missed it in manual analysis

### 5. **`date_or_datetime`**
- **Initially said**: Only in materialized (because it's a LinkML built-in type)
- **You questioned it**: And I pivoted to explaining it's from imports
- **Status**: Never definitively verified if it appears as a key in source files

## Summary

I waffled or was inconsistent on at least **5 metaslots** during this analysis session.
